# Publication Evidence Workspace

The Publication Workspace selects the small set of project evidence that
supports a manuscript. It is separate from project backup and Session export.

Open **Publication** from the project sidebar. It opens a dedicated project page
and keeps the project sidebar available. Returning to a conversation or project
files restores the ordinary workspace. Escape dismisses an open editor or
advanced dialog before navigating back from an evidence-entry step; it does
not close the project page itself.

The page has three sections: **Evidence**, **Finalization check**, and
**Version history**. Evidence pairs the manuscript outline with the selected
results, their analysis lineage, and the recorded purpose / selection rationale.
Exact IDs and verification metadata remain available under **Version and
verification details**. Version history opens the actual stored revision;
creating a new revision retains the historical evidence of its parent.

The page uses the available project-pane width on large displays. The manuscript
outline stays compact while evidence expands into two or three columns on wider
panes. New-paper guidance and its form sit side by side when space permits;
editing forms retain a readable width. Source lists and text previews also use
taller windows. Layout breakpoints follow the pane width, so resizing the sidebar
or using a narrower window returns the page to stacked layouts without changing
evidence order or selection.

A Publication contains ordered
manuscript items (Section, Claim, Figure, Table, Methods, and Supplement) and
one or more revisions. Draft revisions can be edited. Frozen and Published
revisions are read-only; use **Clone revision** to continue work without
changing historical evidence.

**Add evidence** selects registered project results, persisted analysis runs,
or saved research conversation text. Source lists are project/mainline scoped,
searchable, and paginated in batches of 50. Files bind the exact ArtifactVersion
shown in the picker, even if a newer result is created before saving. Message
previews show up to 16 KiB of original text; select a passage with the mouse or
keyboard, or use the entire preview. The editor converts UTF-16 selection
positions to UTF-8 byte offsets automatically. A changed message is rejected at
binding time so it cannot silently reinterpret the previewed passage. Very large
serialized messages (over 256 KiB) are available through advanced exact anchors
rather than the picker. The picker excludes system/tool messages and exploration
results; advanced anchors remain available for the other supported source types.

Registered Artifacts and persisted Runs also expose **Use in publication**. The
binding dialog records:

- the exact target revision and manuscript item;
- the evidence purpose and optional supported Claim;
- Candidate, Selected, or Rejected selection state;
- Public, Restricted, or Private visibility.

An Artifact selection is resolved to its current exact `ArtifactVersion` when
the binding is saved. The binding never follows `Artifact.latest_version_id`
afterward. The evidence panel shows the exact source ID, review and
reproduction state, lineage quality, version/checksum details, drift, and
revision-local supersession.

## Freezing

**Finalization check** separates inspection from locking. **Check this revision**
prepares exact evidence and runs dependency and safety checks, then returns the
revision to Draft even when the checks pass. The check may capture snapshots;
it does not commit a frozen manifest. **Confirm and lock evidence** becomes
available after a successful check and reruns all checks before committing.
Evidence or policy changes invalidate the displayed check. Both commands validate
that the revision belongs to the active mainline project.

Select the intended Capsule visibility (Private by default) and explicitly confirm PHI /
PII and redistribution review where applicable. The readiness panel reports
blockers, warnings, omissions, documented waivers, and the resulting capability
level:

- `archived`
- `traceable`
- `re_executable`
- `reproduced`

Historical live files without trustworthy creation-time checksums are captured
as a new `late_capture` version and reported as
`historical_content_unverified`. They are not rewritten to look like original
Run output.

Public policy never includes Restricted or Private dependency bytes. Those
dependencies remain manifest references or omissions with access instructions.
Frozen evidence and its manifest hash are retained independently of ordinary
Artifact, Session, undo, and garbage-collection operations.

## Building a Capsule

Frozen and Published revisions expose **Build Capsule**. The save produces a
deterministic ZIP derived only from the stored frozen manifest and exact
content-addressed snapshots. It never falls back to a current workspace file.
Every copied blob is streamed through SHA-256 verification before the archive
is published.

The schema-v1 archive contains:

- `capsule.json`, `checksums.sha256`, `README.md`, `REPRODUCE.md`, and
  `CITATION.cff`;
- the exact frozen manifest and selected evidence under `evidence/`;
- Run, input, output, code, and environment lineage under `provenance/`;
- access instructions and reference-only dependencies under `data/`;
- immutable reference results and the verification report.

Entry names, ordering, timestamps, and permissions are normalized. Rebuilding
the same revision from the same immutable blobs produces the same archive
bytes and SHA-256. Public Capsules copy only Public allowlisted bytes;
Restricted and Private dependencies remain metadata and access instructions.
Traversal paths, symlinks, credential-like content, missing snapshots, and
checksum mismatches fail closed. Each attempt is recorded separately from the
frozen revision, including its revision-manifest hash and archive hash.

## Precise evidence and clean verification

Draft revisions retain **Advanced: locate by source ID → Add precise evidence**.
It accepts an exact
`MessageSpan`, `ToolCall`, `ExecutionLog`, `CodeCell`, or `ExternalResource`
identity. Message and tool locators contain the frame, persisted message
sequence, and UTF-8 byte range or tool-call ID. Execution and code anchors use
the exact execution-log ID, never the most recent execution for a path. Wisp
copies the selected text, arguments, result, code, log, or resource metadata
into a hash-authenticated binding snapshot when it is selected. Later Session
compaction or deletion cannot change that snapshot.

A Frozen or Published evidence card with a producing Run exposes **Verify in
clean workspace**. Verification:

- creates a new temporary directory;
- copies only exact input and code snapshots allowed by the frozen manifest;
- clears the inherited process environment and restores a small
  platform-required allowlist;
- rejects non-local contexts, unsafe paths, credential-like commands, and
  commands with explicit network access;
- records the actual context capabilities, host OS/architecture, locale, and
  timezone fingerprint;
- compares every declared output against the frozen reference; and
- stores an append-only reproduction run and per-output report without
  changing the Frozen Revision.

The backend supports byte-exact SHA-256, normalized UTF-8 text, semantic JSON,
and numeric absolute/relative-tolerance comparators. The Workspace action uses
SHA-256 by default and shows environment parity, comparator, output path, and
pass/fail status.

`reproduced` is an effective display capability, not a mutation of the frozen
manifest. Wisp shows it only when every Run named by that manifest has a
completed report with parity for every captured environment field, exit code
zero, and all required comparisons passing. A failed or mismatched rerun
remains `re_executable`.

## Current scope and limitations

Clean verification currently supports local Runs only. Its fresh directory,
allowlist, cleared environment, path checks, and process cleanup prevent
accidental access to ordinary project files, but this is process-level
isolation rather than a hardened OS/container network sandbox. Do not use it
to execute untrusted code. Commands that obtain network access indirectly
through an interpreter or spawned child are outside this release's threat
model.

Structured text, JSON, and numeric comparisons are limited to 16 MiB; SHA-256
comparison streams files of any supported size. The advanced precise-evidence
dialog requires persisted IDs and byte offsets. The ordinary conversation picker
supports passage selection; direct selection from the chat transcript and visual
code-cell selection remain follow-up interaction improvements.
Interpreter, package, container, CUDA, and driver versions participate in
parity only when the selected Execution Context captured them in its
capabilities. A `reproduced` report therefore means the declared outputs were
reproduced under the recorded fingerprint; it is not proof that an
uncaptured dependency was identical.

Wisp does not currently expose destructive garbage collection for
content-addressed Artifact blobs. Frozen source records are protected from
ordinary deletion; any future blob collector must treat Frozen and Published
manifests as retention roots.

Until a clean rerun satisfies the full contract, the product calls the result
a Publication Evidence / Traceability Capsule rather than claiming full
reproducibility.

## Manual smoke check

1. Open **Publication**, create a Draft revision and Methods/Figure item, then
   add a persisted Run with exact inputs, outputs, code, and environment.
2. Open **Add evidence → Research conversations**, select a Chinese/emoji
   passage and bind it. Also open the advanced anchor dialog and press Escape
   immediately; only the dialog should close and the project page should remain.
3. In **Finalization check**, choose Private or Restricted, check the revision,
   and confirm it remains Draft. Change a policy option and confirm the lock
   action becomes unavailable until another check. Then confirm and lock.
4. On the frozen Run evidence card, choose **Verify in clean workspace**.
5. Confirm the report lists environment parity and one result per output. A
   changed output or environment must leave the capability at
   `re_executable`.
6. Open **Version history**, clone a revision, and navigate back to the original.
   Confirm the original evidence remains read-only. Return to a conversation via
   the sidebar and confirm the normal workspace is restored.
