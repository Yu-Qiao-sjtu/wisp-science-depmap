# Browsing conversation history

Opening or reopening a conversation shows its latest messages, including when
entering through Recent conversations in another project. Switching back to a
conversation starts at the end instead of restoring an older reading position.
Within the open conversation, scrolling up still keeps your place while new
messages arrive. Use the jump-to-latest button to resume following new messages.

Running conversations also reload their latest history when opened in a new
window or revisited after switching projects. **Needs you** restores the current
native tool approval in the conversation; responding in another window removes
that card here too. Loading shows **Loading conversation…**, and a failed load
shows an inline **Retry** action instead of the new-conversation welcome screen.
History reads do not change the running Agent's message sequence. If live events
arrive during a load, the window keeps them and retries the outdated snapshot.


Long conversations load in pages and render a bounded window of turns. At the
top, **Show earlier loaded messages** reveals history already in memory;
**Load earlier messages** requests another page from the local database. History
remains available while the Agent is working. A pending request disables the
button and shows **Loading earlier messages…**. If reading or decoding a page
fails, an inline error appears beside the paging controls; click **Load earlier
messages** again to retry. Failed requests do not advance the history cursor.
Reopening a session replaces its paging request. A superseded request cannot
insert older rows, show an error, or clear the newer request's loading state,
even when both requests use the same history cursor.

## Manual smoke checks

- Leave a native tool waiting for approval, open that running conversation in a
  new window via Needs you, and verify both its history and approval are visible.
  Respond in the original window and verify the restored card disappears.
- Switch a window to another project while a turn continues, then return and
  verify progress missed by that window has been restored.


- Open a long conversation from Recent conversations, then open one in another
  project. Verify an unvisited conversation starts at the latest message.
- Scroll up, switch conversations, and return. Verify the latest message is
  visible without clicking jump-to-latest. Scroll up again and verify new output
  does not pull you back down.
- In a conversation longer than 60 turns, repeatedly load earlier messages until
  the first question is available. Check message order and tool results, and use
  Show newer messages to return through the loaded history.
- Start a turn and load older history while it runs. Verify older messages appear
  and the live response remains intact.

Browser tests use mocked commands and synthetic history. Native macOS WebView
behavior and a user's private database still require a local smoke check.
